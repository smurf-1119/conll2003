"
there
is
the

more

there
is
a
genuine
national
interest
in
foster

said

,
head
of

policy
at
the

of

[SEP]
[CLS]
at

,
trade
ministers
will
review
the
work
of

the

the
uruguay

free

commitments
under
its
predecessor
the
general
agreement
on

and
trade
(
ga

)
.
[SEP]
[CLS]
in
june
,
the
w
##to
hailed
singapore
for
its
open
market
policies
but
the
european
union
and
other
trading
powers
called
on
singapore
to
speed
up
the
opening
of
its
services
sector
.
[SEP]
[CLS]
su

##le
said
the
struggle
that
singapore
had
to
wage
in
v
##ying
to
host
the
meeting
would
be
repeated
during
the
talks
.
[SEP]
[CLS]
"
there
is
tension
at
every
step
of
the
way
,
"
since
a
battle
line
between
the
west
and
developing
countries
has
been
drawn
over
the
issue
of
linking
trade
liberal
##isation
with
labour
rights
,
he
said
.
[SEP]
[CLS]
su
##pp
##le
said
hosting
the
meeting
carried
prestige
for
singapore
,
"
however
,
this
is
quite
int
##ang
##ible
as
the
prestige
factor
may
not
necessarily
lead
to
any
additional
investment
and
trade
flows
to
this
region
.
"
from
a
commercial
point
of
view
,
the
meeting
would
be
good
for
singapore
'
s
tourism
industry
,
tan
said
.
[SEP]
[CLS]
a
large
part
of
singapore
'
s
workforce
would
be
mob
##ilised
to
ensure
the
meeting
would
run
without
a
g
##lit
##ch
but
the
average
singapore
##an
"
would
probably
not
be
too
concerned
about
some
of
the
issues
,
"
tan
said
.
[SEP]
[CLS]
"
but
the
more
educated
public
will
realise
that
these
kind
of
things
are
important
for
singapore
as
a
small
economy
.
"
su
##pp
##le
said
any
political
gains
the
singapore
government
would
get
from
the
w
##to
meeting
-
-
ahead
of
a
general
election
due
by
april
1997
-
-
would
depend
on
how
successful
it
was
in
pushing
its
economic
agenda
.
[SEP]
[CLS]
"
if
there
are
any
movements
toward
free
##r
trade
,
then
singapore
'
s
economy
and
the
electorate
would
gain
,
"
he
said
.
"
but
i
do
n
'
t
think
it
would
be
wise
to
play
up
the
political
aspect
of
this
.
[SEP]

secondary
importance
